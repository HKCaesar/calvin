This folder contains rim inflow multiplier data generated by project team #4A for the California Fourth Climate Assessment (2018).

The Excel file explains which rim inflows for the Calvin model have multipliers derived directly from projection data, and which are found by correlation with other rim inflow values. 

The folder rim-inflow-multipliers contains CSV files of the resulting data for each of the bias-corrected downscaled GCM projections. The format of the files is: one row for each month (12 rows), and one column for each of the reservoir points in the model.
